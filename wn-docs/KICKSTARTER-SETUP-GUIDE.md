### STORY CONTENT (Copy/Paste Below)

```markdown
## 🎬 The Problem: Too Many Apps

Setting up a home media server today requires juggling:

❌ Sonarr (TV management)
❌ Radarr (Movie management)  
❌ Prowlarr (Indexers)
❌ qBittorrent (Downloads)
❌ Bazarr (Subtitles)
❌ Jellyfin/Plex (Playback)

**Setup time: 4-8 hours** for technical users. Impossible for everyone else.

• **Future-proof** - Can't be discontinued or paywalled
```

• No "phone home" features
• You control everything
```

### RISKS & CHALLENGES SECTION

```markdown
## ⚠️ Risks & Challenges

**Technical Risks:**
The core platform is already built and working. The main challenge is developing native mobile/TV apps while maintaining quality.

## 8. FAQ

### Page: FAQ

Add these questions:

---

**Q: Is WatchNexus really free/open source?**
```
A: Yes! WatchNexus is MIT licensed and always will be. The Kickstarter funds development of mobile apps and new features. You can self-host the web app for free today.
```

---

**Q: What about legal issues with downloading content?**
```
A: WatchNexus is a media organization and playback tool. It does not host any content. Users are responsible for ensuring they have the legal right to access content. We do not promote piracy.
```

---

**Q: Do I need technical skills to use WatchNexus?**
```
A: Basic computer skills are needed for initial setup (similar to installing any software). Once running, the interface is designed to be user-friendly for everyone.
```

---

**Q: Can I use my existing Sonarr/Radarr setup?**
```

```

```
A: Android apps are targeted for 2-3 months after campaign ends, assuming we hit the stretch goal. We'll provide monthly progress updates.
```

---

**Q: Is there a subscription?**

A: No subscriptions, ever. WatchNexus is self-hosted software you run on your own hardware. One-time backing gets you lifetime access.
```

---

**Q: What if the project fails?**
